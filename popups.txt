Alert popup:

alert popup are called as javascript popup
these popups are uninspectable,undragable,uncolourful,main page will disable when ever these popups arise.
since we need to switch our driver from main page to alert popup.

Alert alt = driver.switchto().alert();

alt.accept()=ok
alt.dismiss()=cancel
alt.gettext()=get the text present in alertpopup
alt.sendkeys()=which is used to enter value in the field

frame or frame popup:
whenever our webpage is divided into multiple sections
then we go for frame handling
to identify the frame is present in webpage or not we need to go to devtool and in inspect section we should type //iframeor
//frame
 if our driver is present in main page we need to switch to frame  than there are three ways
driver.switchto().frame(int i);
driver.switchto().frame( webelement ele);
driver.switchto().frame(String str);


if we want to switch from child frame to parent frame
driver.switchto().parentframe();

if we want to switch to frame to main page
driver.switchto().defaultcontent();

nested frame
when there are multiple frames presnet in a relation of parent child.then we call it as nested frame
driver.switchto().frame(int index).switchto().frame(int index)

after going to first child frame,if we want to go second child we need to go back to parent frame and then second child


Hidden division popup();
hidden division popup are inspectable,colurful,undragable,main page is kept  enabled when these popup arise.



authentication popup:
this popup is uninspectable this popup is generally used in banking sector,beacuse of its security
these popup requires username and password to get inside the web application
username and password can be provided with url with @symbol


driver.get("https://"+un+":"+password"@"+"url");

Notification popup:
these popup arise without any action by web or user.it is rised by itself
these popup are uninspectble
To handle this popup we need to block at the lauching the browser
here we use chromeoptions class and craete the object of class
we call the addaruments() in which we pass "--disable-notifications" 
and we pass chromeoption ref variable in chromedriver();

chromeoptions opt= new chromeoptions()
opt.addarguments("--disable-notifications")
webdriver driver = new chromeDriver(opt)

file upload:
we can handle by using 
sendkeys();
toolkit with robotclass

in sendkeys we directly pass the path of the file
sendkeys only work if we are having attribute type='file'

Tookit with robot class

Stringselection class object should be created in which we pass path of the file
Stringselection s= new Stringselection("path")
now we will configure the toolkit
Toolkit().getdefaulttoolkit().getsystemclipboard().setcontents(s,null);

then by using robot class we will paste the path of file and press enter 


Scrolling:
scrolling can be handle by two ways 
By java
By javascriptexecutor

By java:
by using the robot class
drawback is we need to press keys multiple times

By javascriptexecutor
since it is interface we do type casting
javascriptexecutor jse =(javascriptexecutor)driver
then we call method call executescript in which we pass address of elemnet till where we want to scroll by using webelement
ref varibale
jse.executescript("arguments[0].ScrollIntoView(true);",webelement ref varibale);
 or
jse.executescript("window.scrollBy(int x-axis,int y-axis);");
