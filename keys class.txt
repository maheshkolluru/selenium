Keys handling
Handling the keys of the keyboard by using script  is known as key boardhandling

we can handle by using two classes
keys class
robot class

keys class:
by using keys class we can handle the all keys of keyboard except numbers and alphabets 
we cannot use keys class ouside the sendkeys()

Robot class
using robot class we can handle all the keys of our keyboard
we can overcome all the drawbacks of keys class
robot class coming from java.awt.package
we need to create object of robot class
Robot r = new Robot();
by using reference variable of robot class we need to call two non static methods
KeyPress()
KeyRelease()

r.KeyPress(KeyEvent.vk_stroke);
r.KeyRelease(KeyEvent.vk_stroke);
