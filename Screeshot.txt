we go for screenshot in automation when ever we run our multiple scripts simultaneously
there is chance of fail of scripts

so wherever our script is failed it must take screenshot
here we use Takescreenshot interface and we go for type casting

Takescreenshot sh=(Takescreenshot)driver;

then we call non static method getscreenshot() in which we pass outputtype.file 

File src = sh.getscreenshot(outputtype.File);
and we need to create object of File class in which we pass path where we want store screenshot in .png format
File dist= new File("path.png");

now we use Files.copy() to transfer screenshot from idetool to systempath
Files.copy(src,dist)

dist.getabsolutepath( )
will return the adress where screenshot is present.
