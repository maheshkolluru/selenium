Mouse Handlings:
handling the scenerios of the mouse by using script.
there are multiple Scenerios like movetoelement,rightclick,draganddrop,clicknhold,doubleclick.

Scenerio1:(move to cursor)
To move the cursor we need to craete the Object of Actions class and we need to pass webdriver referenece variable
By using Actions class ref.variable we need to call non static method call movetoelement.
in these method we need to pass address of the element where we want to perform operation by using webelement  ref varia
and we also use mandatory method called perform().

Actions act = new Actions( WebDriver driver);
act.movetoelement(webelement refvariable).perform();

Scenerio2:(right click)
we need to craete the Object of Actions class and we need to pass webdriver referenece variable
By using Actions class ref.variable we need to call non static method call ContextClick().
in these method we need to pass address of the element where we want to perform operation by using webelement  ref varia
and we also use mandatory method called perform().

Actions act = new Actions( WebDriver driver);
act.ContextClick(webelement refvariable).perform();

Scenerio3:(click and hold)
we need to craete the Object of Actions class and we need to pass webdriver referenece variable
By using Actions class ref.variable we need to call non static method call Clickandhold().
in these method we need to pass address of the element where we want to perform operation by using webelement  ref varia
and we also use mandatory method called perform().

Actions act = new Actions( WebDriver driver);
act.Clickandhold(webelement refvariable).perform();


Scenerio4:(Doubleclick)
we need to craete the Object of Actions class and we need to pass webdriver referenece variable
By using Actions class ref.variable we need to call non static method call DoubleClick().
in these method we need to pass address of the element where we want to perform operation by using webelement  ref varia
and we also use mandatory method called perform().

Actions act = new Actions( WebDriver driver);
act.DoubleClick(webelement refvariable).perform();


Scenerio5:(Draganddrop)
draganddrop we can perfom operation in  two ways
1.when we have source and destination
we need to craete the Object of Actions class and we need to pass webdriver referenece variable
By using Actions class ref.variable we need to call non static method call Draganddrop().
in these we need to pass the adresses of the source element and destination element by using web element ref varibales
and we also use mandatory method called perform().

Actions act = new Actions( WebDriver driver);
act.draganddrop(webelement sourcevariable1,webelement destivariable1).perform();

2.when we have source but no destination
we need to craete the Object of Actions class and we need to pass webdriver referenece variable
By using Actions class ref.variable we need to call non static method call Draganddrop().
in these we need to pass the adress of the source element by using ref varible  and int x ,int y
and we also use mandatory method called perform().

Actions act = new Actions( WebDriver driver);
act.draganddrop(webelement sourcevariable1,int x,int y).perform();
